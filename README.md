# Project Overview

Builds a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!

LibriSpeech dataset is used to train and evaluate the models. The algorithm first converts any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. A neural network maps these audio features to transcribed text.
